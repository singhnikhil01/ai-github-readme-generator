## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/singhnikhil01/ai-github-readme-generator.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ai-github-readme-generator
    ```
3.  Install dependencies using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  Set your Gemini API key. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory if it doesn't exist, and add your API key:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual API key obtained from Google AI Studio or similar.

## Usage

After installation and setting up the API key, you can run the application locally:

*   To run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will typically start the application on a local port (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`). Open this URL in your browser to use the generator.

*   To build the project for production:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

*   To preview the production build locally:
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```

Follow the on-screen instructions within the application to input a GitHub URL or upload a ZIP file and generate a README.
